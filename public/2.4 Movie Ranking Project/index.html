                    Princess Mononoke is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD), but it includes fantasy elements.

The film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. The term mononoke is not a namem, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease or death.
